Somebody mixed my medicine
Somebody mixed my medicine

Well you hurt where you sleep and you sleep where you lie
Now you're in deep and now you're gonna cry
Got a woman to your left
And a boy to your right
You start to sweat so
Hold me tight 'cause

Somebody mixed my medicine
I don't know what I'm on
Somebody mixed my medicine
Now baby its all gone
Somebody mixed my medicine
And somebody's in my head again
And somebody mixed my medicine again, again
